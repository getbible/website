# getBible.Life — browser Bible reader

Read the Bible in a browser, create notes and markings, search translations locally, and export passages as Markdown. The live reader is [app.getbible.life](https://app.getbible.life/).

This React and TypeScript application currently consumes GetBible API v2. It is the behavior and data-contract reference for the native [GetBible App](/project/app/) under development. Its deployment workflow belongs to its own repository; the documentation website is a separate GitHub Pages project.

A production-ready, browser-native Bible reader built with React 19, Next.js/Vinext, TypeScript, and the public [GetBible API v2](https://api.getbible.net/v2/translations.json).

## Features

- Every translation, language, book, chapter, and verse is discovered from the API; no Bible structure is hard-coded.
- Shareable URLs and browser back/forward navigation.
- Canonical passage paths such as `/KJV/Ephesians/5`, including direct-link reloads and automatic conversion of restored/query-based passages to friendly URLs.
- Previous/next paging across book boundaries, `Alt` + arrow keyboard navigation, and mobile swipe navigation.
- Deliberate continuous reading: a second mouse-wheel or vertical touch-drag gesture at a boundary opens the adjacent chapter, preventing accidental paging.
- Minimal full-page reading with a compact header and collapsible passage navigation.
- Selectable light and dark reading palettes, including pure black, warm brown, charcoal, and midnight themes, plus adjustable scripture size, RTL support, and accessible controls.
- Persistent markings: click a verse number to mark a whole verse, or select a word or phrase to mark only that text.
- Custom marking colors and category names, with marking groups listed first and the selected group's color retained as the next marking default.
- Portable JSON backup and merge-import for markings, with duplicate prevention and safe bulk deletion.
- Long-term verse notes with Bible-order navigation; backups include notes, markings, and custom color groups.
- Verse notes and whole-verse markings follow the canonical book/chapter/verse across translations; selected word and phrase markings remain translation-specific.
- The visible reading position is remembered down to the verse and restored on the next visit.
- First-time readers open the daily Scripture in King James Version; clicking `getBible.Life` returns to that day’s cached verse in KJV.
- Full-screen-width reading by default, optional page width, nine selectable reading fonts, edge-to-edge mobile reading, and touch-sized controls.
- A glasses button opens the current chapter as Markdown with an H1 chapter heading, valid ordered-list verses, Copy and Download `.md` actions, and the translation’s full name plus copyright/license notice in the footer.
- A muted desktop-only end-of-chapter footer links the current passage to `getbible.life` and displays the dynamically current Vast Development Method copyright year.
- The browser favicon is the replaceable 96×96 `public/favicon.png` asset.
- Translation-wide local search with all-word, any-word, phrase, partial/exact word, case, testament, and book filters. The whole translation is downloaded once, cached against its upstream hash, and searched with Unicode-aware segmentation.
- Search results lock the underlying reader scroll and highlight every matching word using the active appearance palette.
- Opening a search result centers its verse and temporarily emphasizes the verse and matched words for seven seconds.
- Search is non-blocking and incremental: each edit restarts an ordered scan, the first 20 matches appear immediately, and further groups load as the result list is scrolled.
- Appearance can follow the operating system automatically or be switched manually; the selected light and dark palettes are preserved independently.
- Browser Cache Storage for fast repeat visits and offline fallback.
- Every opened chapter is checked against its `.sha` endpoint. Changed chapters are replaced immediately.
- Translation, book, and chapter indexes refresh weekly. Changed upstream hashes invalidate only the affected cache branch.
- The current translation license is displayed with the text.
- Clickable translation credits with complete API metadata, licensing, source details, and version history.
- Persistent reader layout switch between one verse per line and a continuous paragraph.
- Sixty searchable starter marking groups with a compact large-list color picker and editable deployment colors.
- Language-aware translation sorting with a CLDR-backed fallback when an API language name is absent.
- Maintenance and CrossWire synchronization information available from the site footer.
- The complete reader interface follows the selected Bible translation's language. Locale packs cover all 69 language identifiers currently exposed by the GetBible API, switch document direction for RTL languages, and preserve project names, scripture, API book names, and user-created study labels verbatim.

## API architecture

| Resource | Endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| Translations | `/v2/translations.json` |
| Translation books | `/v2/{translation}/books.json` |
| Book chapters | `/v2/{translation}/{book}/chapters.json` |
| Chapter | `/v2/{translation}/{book}/{chapter}.json` |
| Chapter hash | `/v2/{translation}/{book}/{chapter}.sha` |

The API's index resources contain child hashes. GetBible does not currently expose `.sha` files for `translations.json`, `books.json`, or `chapters.json`, so those indexes are refreshed weekly and their embedded hashes are compared. Individual chapters do expose `.sha` files and are verified whenever opened.

## Requirements

- Node.js 22.13 or newer
- npm 10 or newer

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/getbible/app.getbible.life.git
cd app.getbible.life
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open the address printed by the development server.

## Quality checks

```bash
npm run lint
npm test
```

`npm test` runs the TypeScript unit tests, builds the production Worker, validates the artifact contract, and verifies the rendered HTML.

## Deploy your own reader

Deployment is for maintainers of a reader installation. Configure and authenticate your own Cloudflare account and review the repository's deployment settings before running this command from your checkout:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

The deployment script runs all tests, requires Wrangler authentication, and deploys the verified Worker and static assets to Cloudflare. This command belongs to the reader repository; it does not deploy the GetBible documentation website.

## Cache behavior

The application stores JSON responses in the browser Cache Storage API. Timestamps, SHA metadata, marking colors, saved markings, verse notes, daily Scripture, whole-translation search data, and the last visible verse are stored in durable browser storage, so annotations remain private to the current browser and device. The app requests persistent-storage protection when the browser supports it. If the API is temporarily unavailable, a previously cached chapter remains readable and is marked as saved rather than verified. **Clear all local data** requires confirmation and removes every locally stored reader item, including search indexes.

## Deployment marking groups

Edit `config/reader.ts` to choose the initial marking names and colors for a deployment. Browser-customized color lists are preserved across deployments; the configured list is used for new installations or after local site data is cleared. The Markings drawer provides bounded scrolling and search when the configured list grows.

## Interface localization

English source messages live in `lib/i18n.ts`; generated, lazily loaded language packs live in `public/locales/`. The active interface locale is derived from the selected translation's API `lang` value—there is no separate locale preference to become out of sync with the Bible selection. Missing individual messages fall back to English, and historical or low-resource language identifiers without reliable machine-translation support use the complete English pack. Keeping packs as static per-language files avoids adding every language to the initial JavaScript bundle.

To refresh locale coverage after adding or changing an English UI message:

```bash
npm run i18n:generate
npm run typecheck
npm run test:unit
```

The generator reads the live GetBible translation inventory, protects interpolation tokens and project names, and writes deterministic JSON locale data. Generated wording should be reviewed by native speakers before release. Never put scripture, API-provided book names, translation metadata content, or user-created marking names through the UI translator.

## License

Application code is released under the [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://github.com/getbible/app.getbible.life/blob/HEAD/LICENSE) and is maintained by Llewellyn van der Merwe of Vast Development Method. Bible translations retain their own upstream licenses, which the reader displays from each translation's API metadata.

## Contributing and continuous integration

GitHub Actions validates every push and pull request with locked dependency installation, linting, TypeScript checking, unit tests, a production build, and rendered-route tests. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/getbible/app.getbible.life/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the local workflow and maintenance guidelines.
